# Scene declaration file

In the scene declaration file is possible to define 4 different families of variables:

- ## Float variables
   Define a float variable that can be re-used inside the declaration file:
   - Declaration: `float <variable_name>(<variable_value>)`
   - Example: `float x(10.3)`
- ## Material variables
   Define a material variable that describe the behavior of the object in light's interaction.

  A material is defined by two parameters:
   - Emitted Radiance:
   - BRDF:  
- ## Geometrical objects:
  In **LITracer** three different geometrical objects are avaiable
